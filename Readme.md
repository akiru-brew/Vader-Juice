## Process

It sounds so simple does it. Just add the water and malt, steep, boil, add hops, cool, ferment, drink. what could go wrong?

This is why I have a lessons learnt section, i'm here to learn from my mistakes so i can make a better beer next time. My main mistake was being greedy. I usually like to make 10 litre batches, but couldn't decide what adjuncts to add to this beer so instead opted to make a lot more and split it into batches. My boiler has a 35 litre capacity, so it should be easy to make 25 litres of beer.

It wasn't until brew day that I calculated how much water to add to my 11kg of grain. 30 litres! 30 litres of water and 11kg of grain does not fit into a 35 litre mash. I've actually concluded that I can't get more than 7kg of grain into my pipe, but if it want it to free flow then I really shouldn't consider adding more than 5kg. 

As this clearly wasn't going to work I split the mash into 2 parts, one with 7kg and one with 4kg. with the 7kg of grain I only got 24l of water for mashing.

And thats where the second mistake happened. As the malt pipe was so full for the first mash, I didn't put the top plate in place. This resulted in grain falling to under the pipe, and blocking the filter at the bottom making the pump struggle to move the fluid. In fact it got so bad that the pump actually started sucking liquid in reverse, also bringing some grain with it and blocking the plumbing completely. Suffice to say, I am now well versed in brewzilla disassembly.

What actually happened is that I mashed 7kg in 24l of water for 60 minutes, sparged with 2l, swapped grain for a second batch of 4kg, mashed again for an hour and sparged with another 2l of water, taking time for a 75C 10 minute mash out after each mash. As the pump was blocked I stirred constantly with my spoon so vigorously that it snapped in half. 

After the boil I was left with 17 litres of fluid with an OG of 1.223.

## Process checklist

- Activate yeast
- clean brewzilla with Stellarclean
- Add 24l of water
- add crusted campden tablet
- raise to 65C
- use false bottom, bottom plate and top plate.
- add 7kg of grain
- mash for 60 minutes
- prepare boiler
  - clean boiler with stellarclean
  - boil 10l of water
- raise malt pipe
- raise temperate to 75C
- sparge with 2l water at 75C
- replace spent grain with second batch
- steep at 65C for 60 minutes
- raise malt pipe raise temperature to 75C
- sparge with 2l water at 75C
- raise to 100C
- boil for 60 minutes
- Add magnum hop at start
- add candi at 30 minutes
- Add saaz hops 10 minutes from end
- Add 5g irish moss 5 minutes from end.
- chill in place to 25C
- transfer to fermenter
- pitch yeast

## Fermentation

As I was making a large batch I got a new fermenter, a fermzilla. You get a good view of the the beer, and the airlock shows a nice smooth breath from the beer.

Frustratingly it took 48 hours before the gravity started to drop. I spent a day convinced that i'd killed the yeast but it seemed to finally kick in.
